2023-03-09,The Outwaters,2022,https://boxd.it/3XjiFT,2.5,,"I loved the out-of-this-world-lovecraftian elements but I wish they were developed a bit more. I also didn’t get enough pay off for the hour of character development that happens prior to the crazy stuff. You do really get to know some of these characters, but I don’t think any of that knowledge gets used once things go wild.

Recommended for anyone that loves found footage or really likes lovecraftian horror. Made me want to seek out The Void again. I’m glad I saw it but I doubt I would seek it out to watch again. However, some of the images will probably stick with me for a while.","theater, frida",2023-03-06
2023-03-09,Jodorowsky's Dune,2013,https://boxd.it/3XjiTr,3.5,,Recommended for anyone that would like to see a glimpse at what this movie would have been like straight from those that were working on it.,blu-ray,2023-03-07
2023-03-09,Blow Out,1981,https://boxd.it/3XrvGL,3,,"This film was interesting. I'm normally pretty bored by 70's and 80's
pictures. I don't tend to have any context yet about what was done before and
what hasn't been done yet and that tends to cloud my opinions. What I did enjoy
on this one was the camera work and focus on the main characters job as a sound
engineer.

One sequence in particular during the middle right after Jack get's his tapes
wiped where he's going around his studio checking all of his tapes was
great. The camera is placed in the middle of the room and swirls around numerous
times while John Travolta's character is realizing how much damage was
done. It's very effective and definitately reminded me of a lot of my stress
dreams.

Recommended for DePalma fans and Thriller fans.",blu-ray,2023-03-08
2023-03-10,Snowpiercer,2013,https://boxd.it/3XyRpL,3.5,Yes,"I tend to enjoy shows and movies that have a big constraint on location and
setting. This movie entirely taking place on a futuristic train that houses all
that remains of humanity is a great setup. We all know that Bong Joon Ho went on
to make [Parasite](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/) and you can already
see his knack for reveals and suspense. His payoffs at the end of both films are
really satisfying and the writing is truly great in both.

There's a lot I feel like I'm missing in Snowpiercer but I'm not sure I'm going
to rewatch this film enough times to understand it all. Watching it post 2020
definitly brings up different feelings than my last watch. My belief that
humanity wouldn't go along with horrible events has been shattered and this
movie plays into that a bit.

Totally recommended for everyone at some point. Great film with good
performances, great writing and a really great (and unique) sci-fi setting.

2023-03-10,Scream,2022,https://boxd.it/3Xz4u5,3.5,,"I have not seen most of the Scream movies and I only watched the original 20
years ago in college (I feel very old writing that). I'm eager to rewatch I-IV
later today but for now I only remember that it was very meta and referenced a
lot of other horror. It felt like this latest movie (the fifth in the series)
cranks that up to 11.

The meta comedy about the fake ""Stab"" series that's created in world is great
with a lot of self aware jokes about this movie attempting to revive the
series. I feel like they took the spirit of the original and just ran with it
which is a great direction to run in.

They reference other horror by name a LOT in very self-referential ways. I def
enjoyed the watch and I'm eager to see the sixth. However it also made me want
to watch move ""elevated horror"" at the same time cause I think I agree with
Jenna's last line: ""I still prefer The Babadook.""
",,2023-03-08
2023-03-10,Scream 2,1997,https://boxd.it/3XCYpr,2.5,,"This clearly continues the meta-horror commentary that the first movie had. I
enjoyed it and the performances and the sequal jokes. I can't imagine that
anyone who enjoyed the first movie would not enjoy this one. Definitely lays out
more elements that will appear in later films (Stab, etc).

2023-03-10,Scream 3,2000,https://boxd.it/3XDEbh,2.5,,"I definitely didn't end up caring at all about Cotton dying, so the intro was a
bit... boring. I like the continuation of the ""Stab"" in-movie movie franchise.

Parker Posie was a very pleasent surprise. The Jay and Silent Bob cameo was also welcome.
",,2023-03-09
2023-03-10,Scream,1996,https://boxd.it/3XJJR5,3.5,Yes,"Classic. Probably the best intro sequence to all of the films (with Jenna
Ortega's in [Scream](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11245972/) a close
second). Love the campy jokes and the setup for the rest of the
films. Definitely a recommend for anyone that likes slashers.",,2023-03-09
2023-03-10,Scream VI,2023,https://boxd.it/3XJK6J,3.5,,"So just left the threater after watching this. Great (and funny) intro with Samara Weaving. Nice meta references (Argento is mentioned!) and great horror references in a lot of the costumes that people are wearing during the. movie. Nice motives in the end and great performances again from Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega (no surprises there based on the 5th movie).

It was a great time at the threater, I was laughing a lot and the kills were great. I really like this group of friends a lot and they all have great chemistry on screen. It's exactly what I hoped the 6th Scream movie would be!","theater, regal",2023-03-09
2023-03-11,Scream 4,2011,https://boxd.it/3XOM9b,3,,"The new cast isn't used as well as they should be, I wasnted to see more of them which I didn't really get until the final act. The screen time and plot between the original cast and the new cast is not handled as nicely as in 5 and 6 but better than 3.

The normal meta comedy is in full effect and if I liked the killers it would be more effective. The writers couldn't figure out how to keep pulling Sidney back into the plot effectively. I actually liked the killers at the end of 4, they grew on me and the motives ended up being a lot better than 2 and 3.

2023-03-11,Creed,2015,https://boxd.it/3XUV4L,3.5,,"So far through my Rocky movie trip I’ve just enjoyed spending time with Rocky. This movie gives me that. Adonis winning Rocky over is predictable as you can imagine. The plot lines are enjoyable despite this and my main worry is that these movies without Stallone won’t be as enjoyable.

Having Adonis not win his fight is a nice throwback to the original. I really enjoyed Tessa Thompson’s performance. Stallone is still great at playing a character that he obviously loves.",,2023-03-10
2023-03-11,Creed II,2018,https://boxd.it/3XUVjV,3.5,,"Very interesting how this contains a bunch of the plot points from Rocky II and IV. I enjoyed this one more than the first only due to all of the callbacks to the original movies.

Rocky movies always had a lot of heart, and they are heavily leaning into that with this movie. There’s this great shot of Tessa soon after having their baby where she’s sleeping in the hospital bed with her arm over her baby. Very realistic and nice to see. Rocky shares some great parenting advice throughout which I also enjoyed (I’m a sap).

So all in all, Creed II felt like a worthy Rocky movie to me. I still like Rocky more than any other character.",,2023-03-10
2023-03-11,Climax,2018,https://boxd.it/3Y0NFr,3,,"This one was a tough watch. I tend to not like drug sequences in movies and the second half of this one is basically just a long drug sequence. Kept me entertained the entire time and luckily it did show you the end result of most of the characters. A lot of it was tough to watch, characters all respond to the drugs they've ingested differently and most of it isn't good.

I love the dancing and the camera work throughout. I really liked the main performance from Sofia Boutella. The long shots work really well and draw you into the action. However this isn't one I'm likely to return to at any point due to the tough nature of some of the scenes.","theater, frida",2023-03-10
2023-03-12,Get Out,2017,https://boxd.it/3YgWXL,5,Yes,"Wow what a great film. One of the first ones that I decided to watch on my new 4k blu-ray player and TV. I love the cast and how great the story is. This was my first time watching it since seeing it in the theaters and it's great on a second viewing. One of those movies where everyone's actions/emotions are just perfect.

My favorite part has to be the ending, where the cop car shows up and you're just afraid for Chris until the moment you realize it's his friend. What a great sequence... Jordan Peele is definitely the director that I'm most excited to see at the moment, all three of his films have been absolute bangers and I can't wait for whatever he does next.",blu-ray,2023-03-11
2023-03-12,The Silence of the Lambs,1991,https://boxd.it/3YmZkJ,4,Yes,I got to see this on the big screen tonight at the Frida Cinema and it was great. However I do feel this film is front loaded. I love any scene with Anthony Hopkins in it especially when it's with Jodi Foster and just don't care as much for the last section. The dialogue from Lector is just sublime and Jodi plays this part so well. Was a lot of fun seeing it on a big screen.,"theater, frida",2023-03-11
2023-03-13,Dazed and Confused,1993,https://boxd.it/3YDy1T,3,,This might take a few watchings for me.

2023-03-13,Creed III,2023,https://boxd.it/3YFsRD,3,,"A little long winded but excellent story and reason for all of the fights. Lives up to the franchise. Apollo’s daughter is just excellent and adorable and I loved that being added in especially since it ties into the history of his upbringing.

There was also some great shots including one Congo where Adonis is talking to his wife but you only see her in the bathroom mirror reflection so it looks like he’s just conversing with himself and it’s super effective.","theater, regal",2023-03-12

I enjoyed Russell’s very rebellious character but found it pretty unbelievable in terms of his position in the church and the church drama part of the movie was a very thin veil wrapping the rest of the plot.

Enjoyed the ending stuff more than I thought I would, both the final fight and the post fight teasers at what the characters will do next.","theater, regal",2023-04-19

The next day: I LOVED the visuals here. Lots of great camera angles, costumes, production design etc.

Performances from Parker Posey and Patti LuPone are great and that whole 4th act is just such a rush. You're almost hoping that you get some answers about this world and journey and instead you just get more questions.

I have a lot of questions about channel 78 and I really want to dig into that more. The behavior of Toni and Jeeves is just great. I love when trailers make me think the story will go one way and it just goes entirely different directions and this movie had that in spades.

So many moments made our (relatively small IMAX audience) laugh out loud. Either due to absurdity or actual comedy or just the expressions characters had during certain scenes.

I think we'll be finding details in the world building for many years to come.","theater, regal, imax",2023-04-20

The use of Always Be My Baby. The strange dream sequences that morph every time you see them to different people and ideas. Was that Elaine with him at the tub? Did he have a brother? Was everyone in the whole movie an employee of MW? Just awesome.

Next morning additions: I keep going back to thinking about the flashbacks and dreams during the movie. All of them seem to have a lot of hidden clues about stuff that I wasn't able to catch even on my second viewing. Taking note of when his mom is played by each actress for instance.

It seems more likely now that the whole movie is orchestrated by his mom to catch him being a bad son, which has inconsistencies itself of course. Can't wait to see a screenshot to double check how many actors from the rest of the movie we can see in the employee posters on the wall in the mom's house.

While there is an element of enjoying the mundane parts of life to this, that's really more about Wings of Desire I think. From this I saw someone clinging to the mundane due to not getting that type of happiness in other aspects of his life. The amazing scene with him and his sister was just glorious. Made me want to ask so many questions and put so much of his life, routine, and choices in a different perspective. The amount that his interaction with his niece and sister affected his routine was very telling and expertly shot and acted.

2024-10-30,Smile 2,2024,https://boxd.it/7Gj6eb,4,,"Holy smokes. This one was intense. I REALLY liked it. They reused a number of jump scare templates from the first movie, but in new ways where I wasn't ready or expecting it which was REALLY cool to see. They used the new premise and affected characters to great effect. Sound design was excellent (for what they wanted to do of course) and still managed to put in a bunch of underlying themes and cool things in the background. The filmmakers knew the assignment and I feel they delivered, hard.","theater, regal, kerrigan",2024-10-29

I think that sums this up very well but that’s not to say the others in the movie aren’t great as well, they are. There’s a lot of great stuff here. I feel like the almost ham-fisted arguments about belief and religion in the film are also serving as metaphors on many levels as you watch. I really enjoyed it. Will definitely check out other films made by these directors.","theater, alamo",2024-11-11

I loved the first half as much as I've ever had. Vincent D'Onofrio is just stunning. I then enjoyed the second half much more than I had in the past. What an amazing body of work Kubrick had.
